      <p>Hi! My name is Connor Dietrich and I am a senior (Class of 2025) at Fossil Ridge High School and a concurrently enrolled student at Front Range Community College. I have a whole range of interests. Everything from tennis, 
        trains, computers, cars, remote controlled electronics, electrical engineering, all the way to the beauty of nature and photography!</p>
		
      <p>During my time at Fossil, I've done many things. I am an active, and founding member of the Computer Science Honor Society at FRHS. I am the last board member who hasnt graduated yet. I've also worked my way up to 
        team captain of the FRHS Boys JV Tennis Team and plan on being a team manager for the FRHS Girls Tennis Team during their Spring Season. I've completed the whole STEM program here at Fossil and have 
        both mentored, and been mentored, by my peers. I've made some of my closest friends during my time here and I want to attribute that to the wonderful people who have come into my life through programs such as tennis and CSHS. </p>

      <h4>TENNIS</h4>
      <p class="tag">Four Years at Fossil Ridge, Six Years Experience.</p>
      <p class="text_column">Playing tennis at Fossil Ridge High School was a fantastic experience! Rising through the JV ranks and ultimately becoming team captain my senior year was a true honor.  I cherished the opportunity to improve my game, but more importantly, I formed lasting friendships with my teammates that continue off the court.  Even now, some of my favorite times are spent playing tennis with my friends and girlfriend.</p>

      <p class="text_column">My fascination with computers began at a young age.  Initially captivated by the immersive world of video games, my interest quickly evolved into a deeper curiosity about the intricate processes behind them. This sparked a passion for building and understanding these complex machines, leading me on a continuous journey of exploration and learning within the ever-evolving world of technology. I remain an avid tinkerer and student, constantly seeking new challenges and expanding my knowledge in this dynamic field.</p>
      <p class="text_column">This picture was taken at HP Day of Industry in 2022. It is of an Intel server running over 1 TERABYTE of RAM! It drew me to the table the moment I laid my eyes on it.</p>

Every scale of model trains, all the way up to the real deals. I've visited train museums and exhibits </p>
      <p class="text_column">I currently have a 4x4ft &amp; 4x8ft model train boards. They are both running HO (1:87) Scale.My 4x8ft board is my primary board with my 4x4 board being a seasonal Christmas board that gets put up around our family Christmas tree.</p>

      <h4>CARS</h4>
      <p class="tag">HTML, CSS, JS, WordPress</p>
      <p class="text_column">My passion for cars ignited early on, fueled by the sleek designs and the raw power they embody. Everything from the classic muscle car to the modern luxary SUV.&nbsp; More than just modes of transportation, I view them as works of art, each with its own unique character and story to tell. From classic muscle cars to cutting-edge electric vehicles, I'm fascinated by the engineering and technological innovation behind them. Whether I'm behind the wheel, attending car shows, or simply admiring a beautifully crafted machine, my love for cars continues to grow with every passing year.</p>

      <h4>MY CAR</h4>
      <p class="tag">2024 Chevrolet Trax Activ <em>(Right)</em></p>
      <p class="text_column">My 2024 Chevrolet Trax Activ is my passport to adventure. Decked out with every available package except for the sunroof and wireless charger, it's ready for anything I throw its way. The black grille and bowtie emblems, along with those striking 18-inch black aluminum wheels, give it an attitude that matches my own. Inside, the heated seats and advanced infotainment system keep me comfortable and connected wherever I go. This Trax isn't just about getting from point A to point B; it's about embracing the journey and exploring the world in style and comfort.</p>
